# MetaLabCore

Core scripts for fMRI preprocessing and useful utilities for data analysis used by the MetaLab (http://metacoglab.org/, PI Steve Fleming).

Scripts are set up to use SPM tools (http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/) within MATLAB.

See https://github.com/smfleming/MetaLabCore/blob/master/fmri_guide_master.pdf for a walkthrough of basic preprocessing and analysis steps.
